# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Ms. Louise see how different theater campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals.  The results from the analysis will give her some insight and help her better prepare for her next venture.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis report presents data on Outcomes Based on Launch Date.  "Theater" was the one category used to geneate data for this report and months of the year.
Also, the following outcomes were used:  Successful, Failed, and Canceled.

Please find below a line chart of the data collected:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second analysis report presents data on Outcomes Based on the fundraising Goals.  Fundraising goal amount ranges from less than $1,000 to more than $50,000 were used to generate this report.  And, the percentage of Successful, Failed and Canceled outcoomes were used as well.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Making sure that all of my forumlas entered in the Outcome Based on Goals data was consistent.  I made a few errors/mistakes entering in the greater than and less than signs.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1.  Overall the data shows that theater events held in the summer months are more successful, especially in May.  
  2.  A great majority of theater events were successful than not.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1.  Goal amounts less than $10,000 have more success.
  2.  Goal amounts more than $20,000 have higher failure rates.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  1.  Not knowing how much money was pledged
  2.  Type of Theater plays that were successful, failed or canceled

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1.  Outcome Based on Pledged vs Goal amounts
  2.  Outcome Based on Theater events held in the US or another specific country
  3.  Outcome Based on Backers and Average Donations
